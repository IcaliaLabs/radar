We've previously mentioned repository-scanning tools such as <a href="/radar/tools/gitrob">Gitrob</a>, but we are now pushing proactive tools such as (the ThoughtWorks-created) <strong><a href="https://github.com/thoughtworks/talisman">Talisman</a></strong>, which is a prepush hook for Git that scans commits for secrets matching predefined patterns.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">7.

Webpack</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p><a href="http://webpack.github.io/"><strong>Webpack</strong></a> has solidified itself as our go-to JavaScript module bundler. With its ever-growing <a href="https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/list-of-loaders">list of loaders</a>, it provides a single dependency tree for all your static assets, allowing flexible manipulation of JavaScript, CSS, etc. and minimizing what needs to be sent to the browser and when. Of particular relevance is the smooth integration among AMD, CommonJS and <a href="/radar/languages-and-frameworks/es6">ES6</a> modules and how it has enabled teams to work in ES6 and seamlessly transpile (using <a href="http://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>) to earlier versions for browser compatibility. Many of our teams also value <a href="http://browserify.org/">Browserify</a>, which covers a similar space but is more focused on making Node.js modules available for client-side use.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">15. NewRelic</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>We have regularly used New Relic hosted performance monitoring with Ruby on Rails systems in development and production. The combination of fast setup and comprehensive reporting has proven extremely valuable in troubleshooting performance. We are now seeing good results from the New Relic monitoring services for Java and .NET systems.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">17. Codeship</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>This is the description. You can use basic html such as the <strong>strong tag to emphasise keywords and phrases</strong> and insert <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com">anchor links to documentation and referance material</a>.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">18. Pact &amp; Pacto</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>Consumer-Driven Contracts are a testing approach to help service interfaces evolve with confidence without unknowingly breaking consumers. The similarly named Pact and Pacto are two new open-source tools which allow testing interactions between service providers and consumers in isolation against a contract. Both have grown out of projects which are building RESTful microservices and show great promise.</p></div></li></ul><h3>trial</h3><ul><li><div class="blip-list-item">2. Grafana</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>When combining modern techniques and architecture styles, such as microservices, DevOps and QA in production, development teams need increasingly sophisticated monitoring. Simply looking a graphs of disk usage and CPU utilization is not sufficient anymore, and many teams collect application and business-specific metrics using tools such a Graphite and Kibana. Grafana makes it easy to create useful and elegant dashboards for data from a number of sources. A particularly useful feature allows timescales of different graphs to be synchronized, which helps with spotting correlations in the underlying data. The templating system that is being added shows a lot promise and will likely make managing sets of similar services even easier. Based on its strengths, Grafana has become our default choice in this category.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">3. Apache Kafka</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>Many organizations are now looking closely at new data architectures that capture information as immutable sequences of events at scale. Apache Kafka continues to build momentum as an open source messaging framework that provides a solution for publishing ordered event feeds to large numbers of independent, lightweight consumers. Configuring Kafka is nontrivial, but our teams are reporting positive experiences with the framework.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">6. Let's Encrypt</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/"><strong>Let's Encrypt</strong></a> first appeared on the Radar last edition, and since December 2015 this project has moved its beta status from private to public, meaning users will no longer be required to have an invitation in order to try it. Let's Encrypt grants access to a simpler mechanism to obtain and manage certificates for a larger set of users who are seeking a way to secure their websites. It also promotes a big step forward in terms of security and privacy. This trend has already begun within ThoughtWorks, and many of our projects now have certificates verified by Let's Encrypt.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">8. OWASP Dependency-Check</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>In a world full of libraries and tools that simplify the life of many software developers, deficiencies in their security have become visible and have increased the vulnerability surface in the applications that use them. <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Dependency_Check"><strong>OWASP Dependency-Check</strong></a> automatically identifies potential security problems in the code, checking if there are any known publicly disclosed vulnerabilities, then using methods to constantly update the database of public vulnerabilities. Dependency-Check has some interfaces and plugins to automate this verification in Java and .NET (which we have used successfully) as well as Ruby, Node.js and Python.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">9. Pa11y</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p><a href="http://pa11y.org/"><strong>Pa11y</strong></a> is an automatic accessibility tester that can run from the command line and be embedded into a build pipeline. Our teams have had success using Pa11y on a highly dynamic site by first creating a static HTML version, then running the accessibility tests against that. For many systems—especially government websites—accessibility testing is a requirement, and Pa11y makes it all a lot easier.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">11. tmate</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>Pair programming is an essential technique for us, and—given that we’re seeing more and more teams whose members are distributed across multiple locations—we have experimented with a number of tools to support remote pairing. We certainly liked <a href="https://screenhero.com/">ScreenHero</a> but are concerned about its future. For teams that don’t rely on a graphical IDE, using <strong> <a href="https://tmate.io/">tmate</a></strong> for pairing has turned out to be a great solution. tmate is a fork of the popular tmux tool, and compared to <a href="http://hamvocke.com/blog/remote-pair-programming-with-tmux/">tmux for remote pairing</a>, the setup is much easier. Compared to graphical screen-sharing solutions, the bandwidth and resource requirements are modest, and it obviously never suffers from blurry screens. Teams can also set up their own server, thus retaining full control of the privacy and integrity of the solution.</p></div></li></ul><h3>assess</h3><ul><li><div class="blip-list-item">4. Galen</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>Testing that layout and styling of responsive websites is working as expected across various form factors can be a slow and often manual process. <strong><a href="http://galenframework.com/">Galen</a></strong> helps ease this problem by providing a simple language, running on top of <a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a>, that allows you to specify expectations for the appearance of your website in various screen sizes. Although Galen suffers from the typical brittleness and speed issues of any end-to-end testing approach, we have found benefit in the early feedback on design issues.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">13. Zipkin</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>Development on <a href="https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin"><strong>Zipkin</strong></a> has continued apace, and since the middle of 2015 it has moved to the <em>openzipkin/zipkin</em> organization at GitHub. There are now bindings for Python, Go, Java, Ruby, Scala and C#; and there are Docker images available for those wanting to get started quickly. We still like this tool. There is an active and growing community around usage of it, and implementation is getting easier. If you need a way of measuring the end-to-end latency of many logical requests,&nbsp;Zipkin continues to be a strong choice.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">14. Grasp</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>We had our collective minds blown by a little JavaScript command-line refactoring tool called <strong><a href="http://www.graspjs.com/">Grasp</a></strong>. Providing a rich set of selectors and operating against the abstract syntax tree, it is leagues ahead of fiddling with sed and grep. A useful addition to the toolkit in our ongoing quest to treat <a href="/radar/languages-and-frameworks/javascript-as-a-first-class-language">JavaScript as a first-class language</a>.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">16. Repsheet</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>Attacks on web properties using bots are becoming more sophisticated. Identifying these bad actors and their behaviors is the goal of the <a href="http://getrepsheet.com/"><strong>Repsheet</strong></a> project. It's a plugin for either Apache or NGINX that records user activity, fingerprints actors using predefined and user-defined rules, and then allows action to be taken, including the ability to block offensive actors. It includes a utility that visualizes current actors; this puts the ability to manage bot-based threats in the hands of team members, increasing security awareness for teams. We like this since it's a good example of a simple tool solving a very real but often invisible problem—bot-based attacks.</p></div></li></ul><h3>hold</h3><ul><li><div class="blip-list-item">5. HashiCorp Vault</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>Having a way to securely manage secrets is increasingly becoming a huge project issue. The old practice of keeping secrets in a file or in environment variables is becoming hard to manage, especially in environments with multiple applications and large numbers of <a href="/radar/techniques/microservices">microservices</a>. <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/vault"><strong>HashiCorp Vault</strong></a> addresses the problem by providing mechanisms for securely accessing secrets through a unified interface. It has served us well on a number of projects, and our teams liked how easy it was to integrate Vault with their services. Storing and updating secrets is a bit cumbersome, because it relies on a command-line tool and a fair amount of discipline from the team.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">10. Terraform</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>Although <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> is a great tool to define &amp; manage infrastructure using code (<a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/terraform">It was a "trial" blip on ThoughtWorks' Radar</a>), as a team we're going to hold using it. We see that continuously moving an app between infrastructure providers is rarely the case with our clients, and certainly not enough to require using an extra layer of complexity between the DevOps team and the Infra provider. On top of that, our focus with tools such as Docker, and orquestrators such as Swarm &amp; Kubernetes being available on a multitude of clouds (AWS EKS, Google Kubernetes Engine, etc), and the ability to deploy our software as containers spares us from dealing with this in it's entirety.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">19. Vagrant</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>Although this tool has been used in the past to replicate environments on development and productive environments, a sizeable list of dependencies from different vendors (Vagrant + Ansible, VirtualBox, etc) are required for a project to work. As our alternative of Docker + Compose is less complex, simple to use, with better performance and dependencies coming from the same vendor (Docker), we are recommending against using this tool on new projects, and migrate existing projects to Docker+Compose.</p></div></li></ul></div><div class="quadrant-table second"><h2 class="quadrant-table__name">Languages &amp; frameworks</h2><h3>adopt</h3><ul><li><div class="blip-list-item">21. Ember.js</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>If you are faced with building a single-page application (SPA) and trying to choose a framework to build with, <strong><a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a></strong> has emerged as a leading choice. Our teams praise Ember for its highly productive developer experience, with far fewer surprises than other frameworks such as <a href="/radar/languages-and-frameworks/angularjs">AngularJS</a>. The Ember CLI build tooling is a haven in the storm of JavaScript build tools, and the Ember core team and community are highly active and responsive.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">22. React.js</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>In the avalanche of front-end JavaScript frameworks, <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/"><strong>React.js</strong></a> stands out due to its design around a reactive data flow. Allowing only one-way data binding greatly simplifies the rendering logic and avoids many of the issues that commonly plague applications written with other frameworks. We're seeing the benefits of React.js on a growing number of projects, large and small, while at the same time we continue to be concerned about the state and the future of other popular frameworks like <a href="/radar/languages-and-frameworks/angularjs">AngularJS</a>. This has led to React.js becoming our default choice for JavaScript frameworks.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">23. Redux</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>This is the description. You can use basic html such as the <strong>strong tag to emphasise keywords and phrases</strong> and insert <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com">anchor links to documentation and referance material</a>.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">24. Spring Boot</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>A lot of work has gone into <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot"><strong>Spring Boot</strong></a> to reduce complexity and dependencies, which largely alleviates our previous reservations. If you live in a Spring ecosystem and are moving to microservices, Spring Boot is now the obvious choice. For those not in Springland, <a href="/radar/languages-and-frameworks/dropwizard">Dropwizard</a> is also worthy of serious consideration.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">31. JSONAPI.org</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>We're adopting JSONAPI as the standard all of our REST apis should adhere, so we can ensure the representations of the same object are consistent throughout the API</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">35. Ruby</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>This language/framework was included in this edition of the Radar for visibility. We felt that there wasn't anything substantial to add to the discourse around it, but that it was important to keep this in view.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">36. Python</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>Python 3 introduced many useful features that are not backward compatible with Python 2.x. It also removed numerous Python 2.x features that were maintained for backward compatibility, making Python 3 easier to learn and use and more consistent with the rest of the language. Our experience using Python 3 in domains such as machine learning and web application development shows that both the language and most of its supporting libraries have matured for adoption. We were able to fork and patch minor issues of existing libraries or avoided using incompatible Python 2.x libraries that had been abandoned. If you are developing in Python we strongly encourage you to use Python 3.</p></div></li></ul><h3>trial</h3><ul><li><div class="blip-list-item">25. Elixir</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>Interest in the <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/"><strong>Elixir</strong></a> programming language continues to build. Increasingly, we see it used in serious projects and hear feedback from developers who find its Actor model to be robust and very fast. Elixir, which is built on top of the Erlang virtual machine, is showing promise for creating highly concurrent and fault-tolerant systems. Elixir has distinctive features such as the Pipe operator, which allows developers to build a pipeline of functions as you would in the UNIX command shell. The shared byte code allows Elixir to interoperate with Erlang and leverage existing libraries while supporting tools such as the Mix build tool, the IEx interactive shell and the <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/ex_unit/ExUnit.html">ExUnit</a> unit-testing framework.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">26. Enzyme</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p><a href="http://airbnb.io/enzyme/"><strong>Enzyme</strong></a> has become the defacto standard for unit testing <a href="/radar/languages-and-frameworks/react-js">React</a> UI components. Unlike many other snapshot-based testing utilities, Enzyme enables you to test without doing on-device rendering, which results in faster and more granular testing. This is a contributing factor in our ability to massively reduce the amount of functional testing we find we have to do in React applications. In many of our projects it’s used within a unit testing framework such as <a href="/radar/languages-and-frameworks/jest">Jest</a>.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">27. Immutable.js</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p><p>Immutability is often emphasized in the functional programming paradigm, and most languages have the ability to create immutable objects—objects that can't be changed once created. <strong><a href="https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/">Immutable.js</a></strong> is a library for JavaScript that provides many persistent immutable data structures, which are highly efficient on modern JavaScript virtual machines. Immutable.js objects are, however, not normal JavaScript objects, so references to JavaScript objects from immutable objects should be avoided. More teams are using this library for tracking mutation and maintaining state in production. We recommend that developers investigate this library, especially when it's combined with the rest of the Facebook stack.</p></p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">28. Phoenix</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p><p>Some of our ThoughtWorks teams have had very positive experiences with <strong>Phoenix</strong>, a server-side web MVC framework written in <a href="/radar/languages-and-frameworks/elixir">Elixir</a>. In addition to being streamlined and easy to use, Phoenix takes advantage of Elixir to be extremely fast. For some developers, Phoenix evokes the joy they experienced when first discovering Ruby and Rails. Although the ecosystem of libraries for Phoenix is not as extensive as for some more mature frameworks, it should benefit from the continuing success and growth of support for Elixir.</p></p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">29. React Native</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p><p>We are seeing continued success with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/"><strong>React Native</strong></a> for rapid cross-platform mobile development. Despite some churn as it undergoes continuing development, the advantages of trivial integration between native and nonnative code and views, the rapid development cycle (instant reload, chrome debugging, Flexbox layout) and general growth of the React style is winning us over. As with many frameworks, care needs to be taken to keep your code well structured, but diligent use of a tool like <a href="/radar/languages-and-frameworks/redux">Redux</a> really helps here.</p></p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">32. GraphQL</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p><p>When we look at REST implementations in the wild, we frequently see REST misused to naively retrieve object graphs through chatty interactions between client and server. Facebook's <a href="https://github.com/facebook/graphql"><strong>GraphQL</strong></a> is an interesting alternative to REST that might be a better approach for this very common use case. As a protocol for remotely retrieving object graphs, GraphQL has received enormous attention recently. One of GraphQL's most interesting features is its consumer-oriented nature: The structure of a response is driven entirely by the client, not the server. This decouples the consumer and forces the server to obey Postel's law. Client implementations are now available in many programming languages, but we have seen a flurry of interest of Facebook's <a href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/">Relay</a>, a JavaScript framework that was designed to support the <a href="/radar/languages-and-frameworks/react-js">React.js</a> stateless component model.</p></p></div></li></ul><h3>assess</h3><ul><li><div class="blip-list-item">20. orbit.js</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>As we've seen an increase in complex client-side apps using Javascript (React,
Vue, etc), a common requirement is loading data from servers, and
posting/syncing data back to it. It has been a common occurrency for these
projects to have their own classes used to access data, often repeating the same
code over and over again.

<a href="https://orbitjs.com">Orbit.js</a> is a composable framework for
orchestrating change processing, tracking, and synchronization across multiple
data sources, and also <strong>allows working with data offline</strong>.

We're looking forward gaining some experience using Orbit.js, as it looks as a
promising replacement for all of custom code in our React/SPA projects.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">30. ECMAScript 2017</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p><strong>ECMAScript 2017</strong>—not to be confused with ES7 (a.k.a. ECMAScript 2016)—brings several noteworthy improvements to the language. Browsers are expected to implement this standard fully in the summer of 2017, but the <a href="/radar/tools/babel">Babel</a> JavaScript compiler already supports a number of the features today. If you make extensive use of JavaScript and your codebase is under active development, we recommend that you add Babel to your build pipeline and begin using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-es2017">supported features</a>.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">33. echarts</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p><p><a href="http://github.com/ecomfe/echarts"><strong>ECharts</strong></a> is a lightweight charting library with rich support for different types of charts and interactions. Since ECharts is entirely based on the <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">Canvas API</a>, it has incredible performance even when dealing with over 100k data points, and it's also been optimized for mobile usage. Together with its sibling project, <a href="http://echarts.baidu.com/echarts2/x/doc/index.html">ECharts-X</a>, it can support 3D plotting. ECharts is a Baidu open source project.</p></p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">34. Vue.js</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p><p>In the ever-changing world of front-end JavaScript frameworks, one of the emerging favorites appears to be <strong><a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>. </strong>Vue.js is a lightweight alternative to <a href="/radar/languages-and-frameworks/angularjs">AngularJS</a>. It is designed to be a very flexible—and a less opinionated—library that offers a set of tools for building interactive web interfaces around concepts such as modularity, components and reactive data flow. It has a low learning curve, which makes it interesting for less experienced&nbsp;developers and beginners. Note, though, that Vue.js is not a full-blown framework; it is focused on the view layer only and therefore is easy to integrate with other libraries or existing projects.</p></p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">37. Angular</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>In previous Radar editions, we've been hesitant to give Angular a strong recommendation because it was essentially a new, and on the whole unexciting, framework, sharing only its name with AngularJS, an older framework we loved in days past. In the meantime, Angular, now in version 5, has improved steadily while providing backward compatibility along the way. Several of our teams have Angular applications in production and reportedly, they like what they see. For this reason, we're moving Angular into the Trial ring in this Radar, to signify that some of our teams now consider it a solid choice. Most of our teams, however, still prefer React, Vue or Ember over Angular.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">38. WebAssembly</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>WebAssembly is a big step forward in the capabilities of the browser as a code execution environment. Supported by all major browsers and backward compatible, it's a binary compilation format designed to run in the browser at near native speeds. It opens up the range of languages you can use to write front-end functionality, with early focus on C, C++ and Rust, and it's also an LLVM compilation target. When run in the sandbox, it can interact with JavaScript and shares the same permissions and security model. When used with Firefox’s new streaming compiler, it also results in faster page initialization. Although it's still early days, this W3C standard is definitely one to start exploring.</p></div></li></ul></div><div class="quadrant-table third"><h2 class="quadrant-table__name">Platforms</h2><h3>adopt</h3><ul><li><div class="blip-list-item">39. Docker</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>We remain excited about <a href="https://www.docker.com/"><strong>Docker</strong></a> as it evolves from a tool to a complex platform of technologies. Development teams love Docker, as the Docker image format makes it easier to achieve parity between development and production, making for reliable deployments. It is a natural fit in a microservices-style application as a packaging mechanism for self-contained services. On the operational front, Docker support in monitoring tools (<a href="/radar/tools/sensu">Sensu</a>, <a href="/radar/tools/prometheus">Prometheus</a>, <a href="https://github.com/google/cadvisor">cAdvisor</a>, etc.), orchestration tools (<a href="/radar/platforms/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a>, <a href="https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/">Marathon</a>, etc.) and deployment-automation tools reflect the growing maturity of the platform and its readiness for production use. A word of caution, though: There is a prevalent view of Docker and Linux containers in general as being "lightweight virtualization," but we would not recommend using Docker as a secure process-isolation mechanism, though we are paying attention to the introduction of user namespaces and seccomp profiles in version 1.10 in this regard.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">40. HSTS</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p><a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security">HTTP Strict Transport Security</a> (<strong>HSTS</strong>) is a now widely supported policy that allows websites to protect themselves from downgrade attacks. A downgrade attack in the context of HTTPS is one that can cause users of your site to fall back to HTTP rather than HTTPS, allowing for further attacks such as man-in-the-middle attacks. With HSTS, the server sends a header that informs the browser that it should only use HTTPS to access the website. Browser support is now widespread enough that this easy-to-implement feature should be added to any site using HTTPS. Mozilla's <a href="https://observatory.mozilla.org/">Observatory</a> can help identify this and other useful headers and configuration options that improve security and privacy. When implementing HSTS, it is critical to verify that all resources load properly over HTTPS, because once HSTS is turned on, there is (almost) no turning back until the expiry time. The directive to include subdomains should be added but, again, a thorough verification that all subdomains support secure transport is required.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">42. OAuth</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>OAuth is a web-friendly, lightweight standard for authorization that allows a user to share private resources between internet services, e.g., allowing your favorite social networking site to access your photos from your favorite photo sharing site. OAuth is simple, avoids password proliferation, and allows a service to grant bare minimum privileges. If you are exposing your application’s data in a lightweight, web-friendly manner you should strongly consider using OAuth as your standard for authorization.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">44. Kubernetes</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>Since we last mentioned <strong>Kubernetes</strong> in the Radar, it has become the default solution for most of our clients when deploying containers into a cluster of machines. The alternatives didn’t capture as much mindshare, and in some cases our clients are even changing their ‘engine’ to Kubernetes. Kubernetes has become the container orchestration platform of choice for major public cloud platforms, including Microsoft's Azure Container Service and Google Cloud (see the <a href="/radar/platforms/gke">GKE</a> blip). And there are many useful products enriching the fast-growing Kubernetes ecosystem. Platforms that try to hide Kubernetes under an abstraction layer, however, have yet to prove themselves.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">50. AWS Application Load Balancer</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>Amazon recently launched the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-application-load-balancer/"><strong>AWS Application Load Balancer</strong></a> (ALB), a direct replacement for Elastic Load Balancers introduced back in 2009. ALB supports Layer 7 traffic inspection and is built to support modern cloud architecture. If you’re building a microservices-based system using <a href="/radar/platforms/aws-ecs">ECS</a>, the new load balancers will directly understand container hosting and scaling, with multiple containers and ports per EC2 instance. Content-based routing allows segmentation of requests onto groups of target servers, along with independent scaling of those groups. Health checks performed by the load balancers are much improved, with the ability to capture detailed metrics about application performance. We like everything that we see here, and teams have begun to report successful usage of ALB.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">59.

We do recommend that Lambda functions contain only a moderate amount of code. Ensuring the quality of a solution based on a tangle of many large Lambda functions is difficult, and such a solution may not be cost-effective. For more&nbsp;complex needs, deployments based on containers or VMs are still preferable. In addition, we have run into significant problems using Java for Lambda functions, with erratic latencies up to several seconds as the Lambda container is started. Of course, you can sidestep this issue by using JavaScript or Python, and if Lambda functions do not contain a lot of code, the choice of programming language should not matter too much.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">56. Contentful</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>Headless Content Management Systems (CMSes) are becoming a common component of digital platforms. Contentful is a modern headless CMS that our teams have successfully integrated into their development workflows. We particularly like its API-first approach and implementing CMS as Code. It supports powerful content modelling primitives as code and content model evolution scripts, which allow treating it as other data store schemas and applying evolutionary database design practices to CMS development. Other notable features that we’ve liked include inclusion of two CDNs by default to deliver media assets and JSON documents, good support for localization, and the ability — albeit with some effort — to integrate with Auth0.</p></div></li></ul><h3>assess</h3><ul><li><div class="blip-list-item">41. Auth0</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>We have a growing belief that for most scenarios it is rarely worth rolling your own authentication code. Outsourced identity management speeds up delivery, reduces mistakes and tends to enable a faster response to newly discovered vulnerabilities. <strong><a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a></strong> has particularly impressed us in this field for its ease of integration, range of protocols and connectors supported, and rich management API.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">45. Docker Swarm</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>While <strong>Docker Swarm is the easiest container orchestrator to deploy</strong>, and it's heavily integrated in Docker Engine, it's <strong>losing ground against Kubernetes</strong> (Although we might see some parts of swarm creep into Kubernetes, like swarm-kit, network-kit, infra-kit). Docker keeps telling the community that they will continue to support it, as most of their enterprise customers still depend on it... but we can't stop thinking this will change sooner or later. The only case where we would recommend using Docker Swarm is where cluster deployment simplicity is more valuable than readily-available expertise. Otherwise, we'll either stick with a provided platform (i.e. AWS ECS/Fargate, Heroku, etc) or Kubernetes.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">46.

Since then, they completely "pivoted" their product, <a href="https://rancher.com/what-is-rancher/overview"><strong>Rancher 2.0</strong></a> with a new offering much akin of OpenShift and Docker Data Center, getting rid of their "cattle" orchestrator by concentrating efforts on Kubernetes (Thank god!).

The community around .NET Core and other related projects has been growing. New tools have appeared and evolved quickly, such as <a href="/radar/tools/visual-studio-code">Visual Studio Code</a>. There are <a href="/radar/platforms/docker">Docker</a> <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#docker">images</a> based on both Linux and Windows (<a href="/radar/platforms/microsoft-nano-server">Nano Server</a>) with .NET Core that simplify applying a microservice architecture.

Amazon API Gateway</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/"><strong>Amazon API Gateway</strong></a> enables developers to expose API services to Internet clients. It offers the usual API gateway features including traffic management, monitoring, authentication and authorization. Our teams have had positive experiences using this service to front <a href="/radar/platforms/aws-lambda">AWS Lambda</a> as part of <a href="/radar/techniques/serverless-architecture">serverless architectures</a>. On the other hand, we have had more challenges using it as a more general purpose gateway to front HTTP/HTTPS endpoints running on EC2—where we have been stymied by a lack of interoperability with VPCs and difficulty in establishing client cert authentication with the gateway. Due to this mixed experience, we would like to advise teams to trial using AWS API Gateway with Lambda but assess suitability when using it in a more general setting.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">51. Cassandra carefully</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>Apache's Cassandra database is a powerful, scalable Big Data solution for storing and processing large amounts of data, often using hundreds of nodes split over multiple worldwide locations. It's a great tool and we like it, but too often we see teams run into trouble using it. We recommend using Cassandra carefully. Teams often misunderstand the use case for Cassandra, attempting to use it as a general-purpose data store when in fact it is optimized for fast reads on large data sets based on predefined keys or indexes. Its dependence on the storage schema can also make it difficult to evolve over time. Cassandra also has significant operational complexity and some rough edges, so unless you absolutely need the scaling it provides, a simpler solution is usually better. If you don't need Cassandra's specific use-case and scaling characteristics, you might just be choosing it out of Big Data envy. Careful use of Cassandra will include extensive automated testing, and we're happy to recommend CassandraUnit as part of your testing strategy.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">52.

Nuance Mix</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p><p><strong><a href="https://developer.nuance.com/public/index.php?task=mix">Nuance Mix</a></strong> is a framework for natural language processing from the company that created the speech-to-text technology behind Dragon Speaking and the first roll-out of Siri. This framework supports the creation of grammars that allow for free-form user interaction via voice. The developer defines a domain-specific grammar that the framework can train itself to understand. The outcomes are responses to user input that identify the user's intents and interaction concepts. At first, it is limited to phrases close to the ones used to train it, but over time it can start to identify meaning from more divergent phrasing. Though it is still in beta, the accuracy from early exploration has been compelling, and the eventual product is one to watch for application forms that could benefit from hands-free user interaction—including mobile, IoT, AR, VR and interactive spaces.</p></p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">54. TensorFlow</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>Google's <strong><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a></strong> is an open source machine-learning platform that can be used for everything from research through to production and will run on hardware from a mobile CPU all the way to a large GPU compute cluster. It's an important platform because it makes implementing deep-learning algorithms much more accessible and convenient. Despite the hype, though, TensorFlow isn't really anything new algorithmically: All of these techniques have been available in the public domain via academia for some time. It's also important to realize that most businesses are not yet doing even basic predictive analytics and that jumping to deep learning likely won't help make sense of most data sets.

Overambitious API gateways</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>We remain concerned about business logic and process orchestration implemented in middleware, especially where it requires expert skills and tooling while creating single points of scaling and control. Vendors in the highly competitive API gateway market are continuing this trend by adding features through which they attempt to differentiate their products. This results in overambitious API gateway products whose functionality — on top of what is essentially a reverse proxy — encourages designs that continue to be difficult to test and deploy. API gateways do provide utility in dealing with some specific concerns — such as authentication and rate limiting — but any domain smarts should live in applications or services.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">58. Superficial private cloud</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>We've seen the indisputable productivity gains that come from deployment of applications and services into mature cloud providers. Much of that gain comes from the ability of teams to deploy and operate their own services with a high degree of autonomy and responsibility. We are now regularly coming across Superficial Private Cloud offerings within organizations, where basic virtualization platforms are being given the “cloud” label. Often teams can self-provision a restricted set of fixed service types with limited access and little ability to customize the centrally governed “enterprise blueprints,” leading to kludge solutions. Deployment pace regularly remains constrained by manually provisioned infrastructure such as network, firewall and storage. We encourage organizations to more fully consider the costs of mandating the use of an inadequate private cloud offering.</p></div></li></ul></div><div class="quadrant-table fourth"><h2 class="quadrant-table__name">Techniques</h2><h3>adopt</h3><ul><li><div class="blip-list-item">60. Load Testing on the Cloud</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>Load testing should be a constant practice. However, the effectivenes of any load test is capped by the bandwith of the user's connection. Cloud Load Testing services are meant to address this issue by running your load test plan on the cloud. Tools such as BlazeMeter and Load Impact.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">65. Pipelines as code</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>Teams are pushing for automation across their environments(testing), including their development infrastructure. Pipelines as code is defining the deployment pipeline through code instead of configuring a running CI/CD tool. LambdaCD, Drone, GoCD and Concourse are examples that allow usage of this technique. Also, configuration automation tools for CI/CD systems like GoMatic can be used to treat the deployment pipeline as code—versioned and tested.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">66. Threat Modeling</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>With the number of high-profile security breaches in the past months, software development teams no longer need convincing that they must place an emphasis on writing secure software and dealing with their users' data in a responsible way. The teams face a steep learning curve, though, and the vast number of potential threats—ranging from organized crime and government spying to teenagers who attack systems "for the lulz"—can be overwhelming. Threat Modeling provides a set of techniques that help you identify and classify potential threats early in the development process. It is important to understand that it is only part of a strategy to stay ahead of threats. When used in conjunction with techniques such as establishing cross-functional security requirements to address common risks in the technologies a project uses and using automated security scanners, threat modeling can be a powerful asset.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">67. APIs as a product</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p><p>Companies have wholeheartedly embraced APIs as a way to expose business capabilities to both external and internal developers. APIs promise the ability to experiment quickly with new business ideas by recombining core capabilities. But what differentiates an API from an ordinary enterprise integration service? One difference lies in treating <strong>APIs as a product</strong>, even when the consumer is an internal system or fellow developer. Teams that build APIs should understand the needs of their customers and make the product compelling to them. Usability testing and UX research can lead to a better design and understanding of the API usage patterns and help bring a product mindset to APIs. APIs, like products, should be actively maintained and supported, and, easy to use. They should have an owner who advocates for the customer and strives for continual improvement. In our experience, product orientation is the missing ingredient that makes the difference between ordinary enterprise integration and an agile business built on a platform of APIs.</p></p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">70. Lightweight Architecture Decision Records</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>Much documentation can be replaced with highly readable code and tests. In a world of evolutionary architecture, however, it's important to record certain design decisions for the benefit of future team members as well as for external oversight. Lightweight Architecture Decision Records is a technique for capturing important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. We recommend storing these details in source control, instead of a wiki or website, as then they can provide a record that remains in sync with the code itself. For most projects, we see no reason why you wouldn't want to use this technique.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">75. Content Security Policies</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>We are finding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy"><strong>Content Security Policies</strong></a> to be a helpful addition to our security toolkit when dealing with websites that pull assets from mixed contexts. The policy defines a set of rules about where assets can come from (and whether to allow inline script tags). The browser then refuses to load or execute JavaScript, CSS or images that violate those rules. When used in conjunction with good practices, such as output encoding, it provides good mitigation for XSS attacks. Interestingly, the optional endpoint for posting JSON reports of violations is how Twitter discovered that ISPs were injecting HTML or JavaScript into their pages.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">81. Linux Security Modules</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>The Principle of Least Privilege encourages us to restrict software components to access only the resources that they need. By default, however, a Linux process can do anything its running user can do—from binding to arbitrary ports to spawning new shells. The Linux Security Modules (LSM) framework, which allows for security extensions to be plugged into the kernel, has been used to implement MAC on Linux. SELinux and AppArmor are the predominant and best-known LSM-compatible implementations that ship with the kernel. We recommend that teams learn to use one of these security frameworks (which is why we placed it in the Adopt ring). They help teams assess questions about who has access to what resources on shared hosts, including contained services. This conservative approach to access management will help teams build security into their SDLC processes.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">82.

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>In the modern era, software is commonly delivered as a service: called <em>web apps</em>, or <em>software-as-a-service</em>. The twelve-factor app is a methodology for building software-as-a-service apps that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use <strong>declarative</strong> formats for setup automation, to minimize time and cost for new developers joining the project;</li>

<li>Have a <strong>clean contract</strong> with the underlying operating system, offering <strong>maximum portability</strong> between execution environments;</li>

<li>Are suitable for <strong>deployment</strong> on modern <strong>cloud platforms</strong>, obviating the need for servers and systems administration;</li>

<li><strong>Minimize divergence</strong> between development and production, enabling <strong>continuous deployment</strong> for maximum agility;</li>

<li>And can <strong>scale up</strong> without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices.</li>
</ul>

<p>The twelve-factor methodology can be applied to apps written in any programming language, and which use any combination of backing services (database, queue, memory cache, etc).</p>
</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">84. Consumer-driven Contract Testing</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>We’ve decided to bring consumer-driven contract testing back from the archive for this edition even though we had allowed it to fade in the past. The concept isn’t new, but with the mainstream acceptance of microservices, we need to remind people that consumer-driven contracts are an essential part of a mature microservice testing portfolio, enabling independent service deployments. But in addition, we want to point out that consumer-driven contract testing is a technique and an attitude that requires no special tool to implement. We love frameworks like Pact because they make proper contract tests easier to implement in certain contexts. But we have noticed a tendency for teams to focus on the framework rather than on the general practice. Writing Pact tests is not a guarantee that you are creating consumer-driven contracts; likewise, in many situations you should be creating good consumer-driven contracts even where no pre-built testing tool exists.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">85. Unit Test</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>UNIT TESTING is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. In procedural programming, a unit may be an individual program, function, procedure, etc. In object-oriented programming, the smallest unit is a method, which may belong to a base/ super class, abstract class or derived/ child class. (Some treat a module of an application as a unit. This is to be discouraged as there will probably be many individual units within that module.) Unit testing frameworks, drivers, stubs, and mock/ fake objects are used to assist in unit testing.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">86. Code linting</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>Linting is the process of running a program that will analyse code for potential errors. See lint on wikipedia: lint was the name originally given to a particular program that flagged some suspicious and non-portable constructs (likely to be bugs) in C language source code.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">87. Unified IDE Configuration</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>As we tend to use different IDE's &amp; Tools, a way to configure common traits (tab/spaces, etc). Things such as https://editorconfig.org and .gitattributes will help us and we should be already using it.</p></div></li></ul><h3>trial</h3><ul><li><div class="blip-list-item">61. Micro frontends</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>We've seen significant benefits from introducing microservices architectures, which have allowed teams to scale the delivery of independently deployed and maintained services. Unfortunately, we've also seen many teams create front-end monoliths — a single, large and sprawling browser application — on top of their back-end services. Our preferred (and proven) approach is to split the browser-based code into micro frontends. In this approach, the web application is broken down into its features, and each feature is owned, frontend to backend, by a different team. This ensures that every feature is developed, tested and deployed independently from other features. Multiple techniques exist to recombine the features — sometimes as pages, sometimes as components — into a cohesive user experience.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">69. Hosting PII data in the EU</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>In a number of countries, we see government agencies seeking broad access to private, personally identifiable information (PII). The increased use of public cloud solutions makes it more difficult for organizations to protect the data entrusted to them by their users while also respecting all relevant laws. The European Union has some of the most progressive privacy laws, and all the major cloud providers—Amazon, Google and Microsoft—offer multiple data centers and regions within the European Union. Therefore, we recommend that companies, especially those with a global user base, assess the feasibility of a safe haven for their users' data by hosting PII data in the EU. Since we wrote about this technique in the last Radar, we have rolled out a new internal system that handles sensitive information relating to all our employees, and we have chosen to host it in a data center located in the European Union.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">71. Reactive architectures</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>We see continued adoption and success of <strong>reactive architectures</strong>, with reactive language extensions and reactive frameworks being very popular (we added several such blips in this edition of the Radar). User interfaces, in particular, benefit greatly from a reactive style of programming. Our caveats last time still hold true: Architectures based on asynchronous message passing introduce complexity and make the overall system harder to understand—it's no longer possible to simply read the program code and understand what the system does. We recommend assessing the performance and scalability needs of your system before committing to this architectural style.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">72. Serverless architecture</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>The use of serverless architecture has very quickly become an accepted approach for organizations deploying cloud applications, with a plethora of choices available for deployment. Even traditionally conservative organizations are making partial use of some serverless technologies. Most of the discussion goes to Functions as a Service (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions) while the appropriate patterns for use are still emerging. Deploying serverless functions undeniably removes the nontrivial effort that traditionally goes into server and OS configuration and orchestration. Serverless functions, however, are not a fit for every requirement. At this stage, you must be prepared to fall back to deploying containers or even server instances for specific requirements. Meanwhile, the other components of a serverless architecture, such as Backend as a Service, have become almost a default choice.  As AWS Fargate is going on, we can declare tasks that will behave as serverless.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">74. Container security scanning</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>The container revolution instigated by Docker has massively reduced the friction in moving applications between environments but at the same time has blown a rather large hole in the traditional controls over what can go to production. The technique of container security scanning is a necessary response to this threat vector. Docker now provides its own security scanning tools, as does CoreOS, and we've also had success with the CIS Security Benchmarks. Whichever approach you take, we believe the topic of automated container security validation is of high value and a necessary part of PaaS thinking.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">88. Applying product management to internal platforms</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>Companies looking to roll out new digital solutions quickly and efficiently are building internal platforms, which offer teams self-service access to the business APIs, tools, knowledge and support necessary to build and operate their own solutions. We find that these platforms are most effective when they're given the same respect as an external product offering. Applying product management to internal platforms means establishing empathy with internal consumers (read: developers) and collaborating with them on the design. Platform product managers establish roadmaps and ensure the platform delivers value to the business and enhances the developer experience. Some owners even create a brand identity for the internal platform and use that to market the benefits to their colleagues. Platform product managers look after the quality of the platform, gather usage metrics, and continuously improve it over time. Treating the platform as a product helps to create a thriving ecosystem and avoids the pitfall of building yet another stagnant, underutilized service-oriented architecture.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">89. Architectural fitness function</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>Borrowed from evolutionary computing, a fitness function is used to summarize
how close a given design solution is to achieving the set aims. When defining an
evolutionary algorithm, the designer seeks a ‘better’ algorithm; the fitness
function defines what ‘better’ means in this context.

An architectural fitness function, as defined in
<a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/books/building-evolutionary-architectures">
Building Evolutionary Architectures</a>, provides an objective integrity
assessment of some architectural characteristics, which may encompass existing
verification criteria, such as unit testing, metrics, monitors, and so on. We
believe architects can communicate, validate and preserve architectural
characteristics in an automated, continual manner, which is the key to building
evolutionary architectures.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">90. Autonomous bubble pattern</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>Many organizations we work with are trying hard to use modern engineering

An old strategy that, based on ThoughtWorks experience, has turned out to be
increasingly helpful in these scenarios is
<a href="http://dddcommunity.org/strategic-design/">Eric Evans's</a> 
<strong>Autonomous bubble pattern</strong>. This approach involves creating a
fresh context for new application development that is shielded from the
entanglements of the legacy world. This is a step beyond just using an
<a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?AnticorruptionLayer">anticorruption layer</a>.
It gives the new bubble context full control over its
backing data, which is then asynchronously kept up-to-date with the legacy
systems. It requires some work to protect the boundaries of the bubble and keep
both worlds consistent, but the resulting autonomy and reduction in development
friction is a first bold step toward a modernized future architecture.</p></div></li></ul><h3>assess</h3><ul><li><div class="blip-list-item">62. Bug bounties</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p><p>The use of <strong>bug bounties</strong> continues to grow in popularity for many organizations, including enterprises and notable government bodies. A bug-bounty program encourages participants to identify potentially damaging vulnerabilities in return for reward or recognition. Companies like <a href="https://hackerone.com/">HackerOne</a> and <a href="https://bugcrowd.com/">Bugcrowd</a> offer services to help organizations manage this process more easily, and we're seeing these services gather adoption.</p></p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">64.

Data Lake</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>A Data Lake is an immutable data store of largely unprocessed "raw" data, acting as a source for data analytics. While the technique can clearly be misused, we have used it successfully at clients, hence motivating its move to trial. We continue to recommend other approaches for operational collaborations, limiting the use of the data lake to reporting, analytics and feeding data into data marts.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">73. Client-directed query</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>Although many problems that people encounter with RESTful approaches to APIs can be attributed to the <a href="/radar/techniques/anemic-rest">anemic REST</a> antipattern, some use cases warrant exploration of other approaches. In particular, organizations that have to support a long tail of client applications (and thus a likely proliferation of API versions even if they employ <a href="/radar/techniques/consumer-driven-contract-testing">consumer-driven contracts</a>)—and have a large portion of their APIs supporting the endless-list style of activity feeds—may hit some limits in RESTful architectures. These can sometimes be mitigated by employing the <strong>client-directed query</strong> approach to client-server interaction. We see this approach being successfully used in both <a href="/radar/languages-and-frameworks/graphql">GraphQL</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/falcor">Falcor</a>, where clients have more control over both the contents and the granularity of the data returned to them. This does put more responsibility onto the service layer and can still lead to tight coupling to the underlying data model, but the benefits may be worth exploring if well-modeled RESTful APIs aren't working for you.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">76. Differential privacy</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>It has long been known that "anonymized" bulk data sets can reveal information about individuals, especially when multiple data sets are cross-referenced together. With increasing concern over personal privacy, some companies—including Apple and Google—are turning to differential privacy techniques in order to improve individual privacy while retaining the ability to perform useful analytics on large numbers of users. Differential privacy is a cryptographic technique that attempts to maximize the accuracy of statistical queries from a database while minimizing the chances of identifying its records. These results can be achieved by introducing a low amount of "noise" to the data, but it's important to note that this is an ongoing research area. Apple has announced plans to incorporate differential privacy into its products—and we wholeheartedly applaud its commitment to customers' privacy—but the usual Apple secrecy has left some security experts scratching their heads. We continue to recommend Datensparsamkeit as an alternative approach: simply storing the minimum data you actually need will achieve better privacy results in most cases.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">77. OWASP ASVS</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>As more development teams incorporate security earlier in the development life cycle, figuring out requirements to limit security risks can seem like a daunting task. Few people have the extensive technical knowledge needed to identify all the risks that an application might face, and teams might struggle just trying to decide where to begin. Relying on frameworks such as OWASP's ASVS (Application Security Verification Standard) can help make this easier. Although somewhat lengthy, it contains a thorough list of requirements categorized by functions such as authentication, access control, and error handling and logging, which can be reviewed as needed. It is also helpful as a resource for testers when it comes time to verify software.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">78. Unikernels</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>With the continued rise to domination of the container model led by Docker adoption, we think it's worth calling attention to the continued rapid development in the Unikernel space. Unikernels are single-purpose library operating systems that can be compiled down from high-level languages to run directly on the hypervisors used by commodity cloud platforms. They promise a number of advantages over containers, not least their superfast startup time and very small attack surface area. Many are still at the research-project phase— Linuxkit from Docker, Drawbridge from Microsoft Research, MirageOS and HaLVM amongst others—but we think the ideas are very interesting and combine nicely with the technique of serverless architecture.</p></div></li></ul><h3>hold</h3><ul><li><div class="blip-list-item">63. Anemic REST</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>With the increasing popularity of the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/bff-backend-for-frontends">BFF - Backend for frontends</a> pattern and use of one-way data-binding frameworks like
<a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/react-js">React.js</a>, we've noticed a backlash against REST-style architectures. Critics accuse REST of causing chatty, inefficient interactions among systems and failing to adapt as client needs evolve. They offer frameworks such as 
<a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/graphql">GraphQL</a> or
<a href="https://netflix.github.io/falcor/&gt;Falcor&lt;/a&gt; as alternative data-fetch mechanisms that let the client specify the format of the data returned. But in our experience, it isn't REST that causes these problems. Rather, they stem from a failure to properly model the domain as a set of resources. Naively developing&#10;services that simply expose static, hierarchical data models via templated URLs&#10;result in an &lt;strong&gt;anemic REST&lt;/strong&gt; implementation. In a richly modeled&#10;domain, REST should enable more than simple repetitive data fetching. In a fully evolved RESTful architecture, business events and abstract concepts are also modeled as resources, and the implementation should make effective use of hypertext, link relations and media types to maximize decoupling between&#10;services. This antipattern is closely related to the &lt;a href=">Anemic Domain Model</a>
pattern and results in services that rank low in <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html">Richardson Maturity Model</a>.

Big Data envy</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>We continue to see organizations chasing "cool" technologies, taking on unnecessary complexity and risk when a simpler choice would be better. One particular theme is using distributed, Big Data systems for relatively small data sets. This behavior prompts us to put <strong>Big Data envy</strong> on hold once more, with some additional data points from our recent experience. The <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">Apache Cassandra</a> database promises massive scalability on commodity hardware, but we have seen teams overwhelmed by its architectural and operational complexity. Unless you have data volumes that require a 100+ node cluster, we recommend against using Cassandra. The operational team you'll need to keep the thing running just isn't worth it. While creating this edition of the Radar, we discussed several new database technologies, many offering "10x" performance improvements over existing systems. We're always skeptical until new technology—especially something as critical as a database—has been properly proven. <a href="/radar/tools/jepsen">Jepsen</a> provides <a href="http://jepsen.io/analyses.html">analysis</a> of database performance under difficult conditions and has found <a href="https://aphyr.com/posts/283-call-me-maybe-redis">numerous</a> <a href="https://aphyr.com/posts/284-call-me-maybe-mongodb">bugs</a> in various NoSQL databases. We recommend maintaining a healthy dose of skepticism and keeping an eye on sites such as Jepsen when you evaluate database tech.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">80. Cloud lift and shift</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>As more organizations are choosing to deploy applications in the cloud, we're regularly finding IT groups that are wastefully trying to replicate their existing data center management and security approaches in&nbsp;the cloud. This often comes in the form of firewalls, load balancers, network proxies, access control, security appliances and services that are extended into the cloud with minimal rethinking. We've seen organizations build their own orchestration APIs in front of the cloud providers to constrain the services that can be utilized by teams. In most cases these layers serve only to cripple the capability, taking away most of the intended benefits of moving to the cloud. In this edition of the Radar, we've chosen to rehighlight <strong>cloud lift and shift</strong> as a technique to avoid. Organizations should instead look more deeply at the intent of their existing security and operational controls, and look for alternative controls that work in the cloud without creating unnecessary constraints. Many of those controls will already exist for mature cloud providers, and teams that adopt the cloud can use native APIs for self-serve provisioning and operations.</p></div></li><li><div class="blip-list-item">91. Complex dev stacks on initial sprints</div><div class="blip-item-description"><p>We've noticed a common pattern on several of our startup-oriented projects for which the stack was divided into the seemingly innocuous "Backend + Frontend" code: They all get heavily delayed, and estimations tend to grow to ridiculous levels. This comes from the fact that developers have to deal with complexities of a multi-layered stack while dealing with functionality changes expected from an upcoming product. Unless the team members have solid experience on all the components of a multi-component tech stack, we advice our teams to stick to lightly-javascript-sprinkled, "vanilla" web apps. <strong>PJAX</strong> libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks">Turbolinks</a> can help speed up the user experience on these kinds of applications, a common invalid argument against "vanilla" apps.</p></div></li></ul></div><svg id="radar-plot" width="666" height="680"><g class="quadrant-group quadrant-group-first" style="opacity: 1;"><path
